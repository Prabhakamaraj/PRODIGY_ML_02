# PRODIGY_ML_02
About the Project
This project was created for Task 02 of my internship at Prodigy Infotech. The goal is to use the K-means clustering algorithm to segment retail customers based on their shopping behavior.
Clustering helps businesses group similar types of customers together â€” for example, those who spend a lot, those who visit frequently, and those who are more budget-conscious.

Dataset Used
Source: Kaggle - Customer Segmentation

File Name: Mall_Customers.csv

The dataset includes the following fields:

CustomerID

Gender

Age

Annual Income (k$)

Spending Score (1-100)

Objective
Use K-means clustering to identify groups of customers based on their:

Annual Income

Spending Score

These clusters can help identify different types of shoppers and create targeted marketing strategies.
